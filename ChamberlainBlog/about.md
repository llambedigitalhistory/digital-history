<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>My name is Arthur Neville Chamberlain, but I go by Neville. I was born on March 18, 1869, in Birmingham, England. 
My father's name was Joseph Chamberlain and my mother was Florence Kenrick, but she died when I was very young.</p>

<p>I attended Rugby School as a boy and then studied at Mason College, (which will go on to be called the University of Birmingham in the future, or so I hear). 
After travelling a bit to try and earn some money for my family, I entered into business and purchased Company, which made metal ship births. I did 
this for 17 years and the company had thriving success which inspired me to become more involved in civic affairs as well. This led me to help found 
the United Hospitals Committee of the British Medical Association in 1906.</p>

<p>In 1910, while under the impression that I would continue my life as a single man, I was lucky enough to meet Anne Cole with 
whom I fell in love almost instantly. She and I have two children together and altogether, we are a very happy family. Anne is 
wonderful and I owe part of my political career to her as she always supported and endorsed me.</p>

<p>I have had much experience in politics over the years including in 1911 when I stood as a Liberal Unionist for the Birmingham 
City Council, in 1915 when I was made Lord Mayor of Birmingham, and in 1916 when David Lloyd George appointed me to Director of National 
Service. This position was short-lived, however, because of the little support I received which led me to resign in 1917.</p>

<p>I have been an active Member of Parliament and have served as Postmaster General, Minister of Health in 1922, and in 1923 I was 
promoted by Stanley Baldwin to Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>The biggest part of my political career, however, is just beginning. I have recently been made Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
 and I couldnâ€™t be more excited. I have decided to start this blog to keep track of my progress and to keep the public informed of any 
 and all political movements that will take place under my regime.</p>
 
<p>I wish to thank everyone for the support they have offered me and I promise I will not let you down, even with a potential war on the
 horizon, we will remain strong as a nation and we will not be pushed aside. I look forward to serving you all as your Prime Minister in 
 what I hope is a long and prosperous term.</p>
 
 <p>Thank you for following my blog and stay tuned for updates.</p>
